# HUMANITY OS Release Readiness

## Current state

**Not release-ready.** The project has a useful local HUMANITY ONE prototype, but its stacked implementation PRs have not been merged into \`main\`. Passing CI on feature branches is not the same as an integrated release.

## Implemented prototype capabilities

- Fail-closed authentication boundary and loopback-only ASGI peer enforcement.
- Local SQLite personal knowledge records, evidence/decision structures and portable export/import.
- Portable workspace schema 1.2.0 with document and explicit memory records; imports from schemas 1.0.0 and 1.1.0 remain supported.
- Local UTF-8 TXT/Markdown ingestion, source-preserving chunks, lexical search and bounded source-cited context packets.
- Explicit memory proposal, owner approval/rejection, archive/restore and append-only lifecycle events.
- Responsive local browser interface for notes, documents and memory review.
- Provider-neutral model gateway and source-grounded answer orchestration with per-request provider-processing consent.
- No model provider, network integration or production deployment is enabled by default.

## Required before a public 0.1 release

### Integration and verification
- [ ] Review and integrate the stacked PR chain bottom-up: #1 → #3 → #5 → #7 → #9 → #11 → #13 → #15 → #17.
- [ ] Re-run full CI and end-to-end acceptance against the resulting \`main\` branch.
- [ ] Verify fresh install, password setup, local startup, backup, restore and portable import on a clean machine.
- [ ] Build and inspect a wheel/sdist; verify static UI assets are included.
- [ ] Select a versioning and release artifact/signing policy.

### Security and privacy
- [ ] Independent security review and penetration test of authentication, CSRF, session lifecycle, loopback enforcement, export/import and browser UI.
- [ ] Define document and memory deletion, retention expiry and backup disposal workflows.
- [ ] Review privacy disclosures and legal basis for personal data processing.
- [ ] Decide encryption-at-rest, encrypted export and key recovery policy.
- [ ] Review dependency and supply-chain policy, SBOM and release provenance.
- [ ] Decide incident response, vulnerability disclosure and security update process.

### Product quality and governance
- [ ] Formal accessibility audit against a selected WCAG target; current UI is not certified.
- [ ] Validate core workflows manually on supported desktop and mobile browsers.
- [ ] Decide license, governance, contribution rules and ownership/representation model.
- [ ] Resolve open constitutional, identity, federation, retention, funding and agent-policy decisions.
- [ ] Add user-facing data export, deletion and recovery guidance.

### Deferred capabilities
- [ ] PDF/DOCX parsers, OCR, parser isolation and malformed-file testing.
- [ ] Semantic retrieval and answer-quality/semantic-entailment evaluation.
- [ ] Provider-specific adapters with provider locality/data residency disclosure and separate approval.
- [ ] Agent Runtime, tool permissions, sandboxing and human approval for consequential actions.
- [ ] Multi-user access, federation and collaboration.
- [ ] Full responsive workspace, account/session management and memory correction UX.

## Release rule

Do not tag, publish, deploy, expose to a LAN/public network, activate a remote provider, or merge stacked PRs solely because feature-branch CI passes. Each requires its own review and explicit release authorization.
